# Maximizing Profits: Algorithmic Strategies Unveiled
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of various investment portfolios including algorithmic, hedge fund, and mutual fund portfolios, alongside the S&P TSX 60 Index. The primary objectives were to evaluate the performance and risk associated with each portfolio, compute daily and cumulative returns, and assess each portfolio's risk profile through standard deviation and Sharpe ratios. Additionally, the project entailed constructing a custom portfolio comprising selected stocks, calculating its weighted returns, and comparing its performance against established financial giants and market benchmarks. Through various statistical techniques and visualization tools, the project aimed to provide a thorough quantitative analysis that would guide investment decisions by highlighting the most lucrative and stable investment opportunities.
